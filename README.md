## üß† Key Research Questions
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, information theory, and signal processing, with a focus on data privacy, representation learning, algorithmic fairness, and federated learning, and computational efficiency of large-scale AI models. My research addresses the following key questions within these topics:



- How can we design robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to protect sensitive data in biometric systems and digital health applications? 

- How can we enhance representation learning to improve the accuracy, fairness, interpretability, privacy, robustness, and generalizability of AI models?

- What methodologies can effectively identify, quantify, and mitigate biases in human decisions and AI predictions?

- How can we optimize federated learning to balance privacy, computational efficiency, and scalability in distributed systems?

- What are the theoretical foundations and practical trade-offs in optimizing LLM inference efficiency and scalability in real-world applications?

These questions have implications for the development of trustworthy and efficient AI technologies in domains such as biometrics, healthcare, and medical imaging and large-scale AI models.
